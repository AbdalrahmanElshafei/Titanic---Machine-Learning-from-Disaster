# ðŸš¢ Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This project is my submission for the Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

The goal of the competition is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck using basic information such as age, gender, ticket class, and more.

## ðŸ“Š What I Did

- Performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data distribution and key patterns
- Handled **missing values** in columns like Age, Cabin, and Embarked
- Engineered new features such as:
  - `Title` extracted from the Name
  - `FamilySize` and `IsAlone`
  - Simplified `Cabin` data into ordinal categories
- Applied and compared several **machine learning models**, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- Evaluated models using **cross-validation** and accuracy score
- Prepared and submitted predictions to Kaggle for evaluation
